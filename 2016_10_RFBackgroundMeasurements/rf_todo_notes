1)compare data
all the x values are the same. y values seem to be a little different. I'm
going to find the range. I will then plot the range as a function of x. I will
call this comparison a consistency measurement.

The spread is about 1e-3 dB
That corresponds to 
10*log10(high)- 10*log10(low)= 1e-3
10*log10(high/low) = 1e-3
high/low = 1.0002302850208247

The measurement has 17 sig figs, so I don't feel bad keeping all of those
measurements.

I can just keep my uncertainties in dB and then worry about what that means in
terms of ratios when I do error propogation. 
I won't do relative uncertainty. I'll just do raw span in dB

Why is the 0 frequency measurement in CF 3000MHz 46 dB

What is up with all the jaggedness? They are consistent.

There isn't this multiple run thing for the smaller bandwidth measurements.

2)combine data

Ok. So data is more or less consistent. Now to combine data with different
ranges.

I think I will just concatenate and bin.
